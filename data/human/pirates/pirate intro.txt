conversation "I Want To Be A Pirate"
	`The drinking holes flanking this outlaw spaceport are a motley mix indeed, each apparently shabbier, dingier, or more raucous than the last. Perhaps that's just the way you like your establishments; perhaps not. Whatever the case, a sense of purpose has brought you here, far from the factories and fields of New Boston. Out here to the fringes of society.`
	`	Instinct - or an overabundance of swashbuckling serials consumed during your childhood - brings you to the back of a smoky bar, where a trio of grizzled ruffians sit: an eyepatched Corsair festooned in somewhat anachronistic couture; a jewelry-encrusted Capo with a mechanical jaw and the haughty bearing of a born and bred gangster; and a Mercenary wearing a beret and military fatigues. A patch affixed to her shirt identifies her as a member of the "Devil's Due Contracting Company". The three turn to stare at you. You came here for a reason, didn't you?`
	choice
		`	"My name is <first> <last>, and I want to be a pirate."`
		`	(This was a terrible idea. Back to the ship.)`
			goto retreat
	`	The three regard you with a mixture of surprise and bemusement.`
	`	"Is that so?" inquires the woman dressed for war. "And you're telling us why? Because you suspect that we might know the right people to, say, make it known that there's a new terror plying the hyperlanes?" She leans back, pauses, carefully inspects the seat behind her, and satisfied that it's not covered in too much grease, completes the maneuver. "...Well, you'd be right. But nothing in this world is free."`
	`	"Aye, it be not enough to simply cover yer' ship with the old black-and-red. A pirate must earn the respect - or fear - of their fellows, lest they be seen as fair plunder," the Corsair contributes. This is followed up with an entirely gratuitous but quite hearty "Arrrrgh."`
	`	The Capo speaks last, jaw motionless; his voice is provided by a cybernetic vocoder, mellifluous if gently synthetic. "Indeed. There's three things you'll need to do before you'll be taken seriously. Speaking personally, I'm always on the eye for upcoming talent. Prove that you've got what it takes and I'm sure at least one of us would make it known within our circles that you aren't to be trifled with - and perhaps even worth offering work to. But first, those tasks."`
	choice
		`	(Nod towards the Corsair.) "Does he always speak like that?"`
		`	"Oh, I know! I need to master theft, swordplay, and treasure hunting!"`

			goto tasks
		`	(This was a terrible idea. Back to the ship.)`
			goto retreat
	`	"Oh, leave him be," the Mercenary scolds you. "He always wanted to retire to Buccaneer Bay and, well, you know how they've got that romanticized view of the old Earth tales, back when ships didn't need to be pressurized cans." The Corsair smiles, somewhat sheepishly. He doesn't seem to have the heart to "Aaargh" this time.`
		goto tasks
	label hahareferencegoeshere
	`	The trio of outlaws stare at you, bewilderment evident on their faces. "What the hell? You've been watching too many serials, kid." The cybernetic Capo shakes his head woefully. "Well, you're not going to last long out here." Only the Corsair seems to be - if only a smidgen - delighted with your approach to piracy.`
	choice
		`	(Marinate in an uncomfortable silence.)`
	`	The Corsair clears his throat, eager to move back to the topic at hand. "Now, about them tasks..."`
	label tasks
	`	The Corsair leans over the table, a wide grin splitting his face perpendicular to the scar that runs from brow to chin. "It's simple, matey. Ye need to prove you're not to be trifled with. Find a juicy prize, disable them, board them, and when other scalliwags come sniffing? Defend your plunder! No scavenger of the black'll displace you from your next meal, by thunder!" Spit and ale fly from the Corsair's lips as he roars, as jolly as can be - and more than a little drunk.`
	`	The gun-for-hire rolls her eyes, though she's careful to ensure she's safely behind the Corsair's back before doing so. "Violence will get you only so far. True power comes from wealth. The fastest engines and biggest guns won't save you when you're too poor to bribe a judge, or even a lowly spaceport controller. Besides - you also need to keep your quartermaster happy. Liquid solvency, my novice, is the only real safety that a pirate can hope to have. You'll find that other assets are liable to be seized by the state. You're best off keeping your pockets full and your real estate holdings light. You show off your spending power and I'll consider that proof enough of your talent - and my fee for putting words into the right ears that you're not someone to mess with."`
	`	There's an electronic laugh from the edge of the table, followed by a cloud of clove-scented smoke emerging from vents in the cyborg's throat. "Wealth. Respect. None of these matter - the only thing that'll keep you safe in the end is power. If you can't control the fates of others, you'll never be able to dictate your own destiny. There are too many people fighting for the top. Prove you belong there. Find a settlement, sack it, slay the defenders, and force them to acknowledge your superiority. People like us - we shouldn't work for our rightful rewards. It falls to lesser men to furnish us with what we want. Force others to acknowledge your will and render tribute, and you'll have earned my approval."`
	choice
		`	"Can't I just murder anybody who might oppose me?"`
		`	"Tell me what I need to do.`
			goto explanation
	`	The three take a moment to look at one-another, apparently gauging which of them is to field that particular question. Eventually, the Capo speaks up, setting down his mug in order to lace ring-laden fingers together in an attempt to look thoughtful and measured.`
	`	"The path of violence only creates more violence, friend. To truly walk the path of the pirate you need to learn to live in harmony with your fellow buccaneers." The Capo smiles beatifically; the effect is somewhat ruined by the wicked titanium teeth machined into his mechanical jaw. Meanwhile, the Corsair is struggling to keep a straight face while the camoflage-clad woman leaks muffled laughs into a napkin.`
	`	"More seriously, no. Simply slaughtering your way across the stars will only get you mired in endless strife, and it's hard to accomplish goals when you've got enemies breathing down your neck at all hours. It's an easy path to sleeping alone, every night, for the rest of your life, lest you wake with a knife in your guts. And that's not a life well lived by my reckoning." The cyborg unlaces his fingers, instead reaching to his side to twine them around the wrist of the Mercenary, taking her hand and guiding it to his fearsome metal maw. In lieu of a kiss, he simply scrapes his teeth across her fingers, one by one, with loving care and measured pace.`
	`	"Mark my words: there are better things in life than simply seeing your enemies laid to waste. You want them to respect your power, but not feel so threatened that they would devote themselves to your destruction. When you kill, do so thoughtfully." The Mercenary, meanwhile, is sporting thoroughly flushed cheeks by this point - though she yanks her hand back and gives the Capo a gentle smack on the jaw before averting her gaze. There's a hint of a smile upon her chapped lips, and regret hidden deep within tired eyes.`
	choice
		`	"I don't understand. Could you explain that more plainly?"`
		`	"Tell me what I need to do."`
			goto explanation
	`	The Capo groans, shakes his head mournfully, and leans back to excuse himself from the conversation for a minute. The Mercenary quickly fills the silence. "Look, it's simple. You shoot people, they shoot back. You knuckle under at every opportunity, they keep shooting because they think you're weak. If you want to be left alone you need to prove that you're not worth the effort it would take to plunder you, yeah? That's... Well, it's what these little tasks we've mentioned are about. You need to establish a reputation. This is how you do it - and once you've done that, other pirates should leave you alone owing to either fear or respect."`
	`	She leans back in her chair, matching gaze with the Capo. "And you, don't push it. Not here, you know what my boss thinks." Wistfulness drips from her words, and her gaze turns past the table and off into the distance. This person's thoughts clearly lie elsewhere at the moment.`
	choice
		`	"I understand."`
		`	"Yeah, I have no idea what you're talking about, but I don't care enough to ask again. Where's the part where I get to be a pirate?"`
	label explanation
	`	"Now," the Corsair begins, "I know a juicy prize is going to be sailing-" The other two turn to fix the Corsair with a skeptical gaze. The Capo's maw slips wide for a moment, as if he wants to interrupt, but eventually it closes silently once more, and the Corsair continues. "-SAILING, I say, through Umbral. In fact, any buccaneer worth their salt knows she'll be there, so you're liable to have more than a little competition. Board her, plunder her, keep what ye like - but should ye find an antique wood lockbox, yer' to bring it back to me without peeking within. That'll be my price for spreading the word of yer' glorious ascent to piratehood.`
	`	"As for me?" The Devil's Due member takes her turn to speak. "Take a million credits to Smuggler's Den in Men. I don't care where you get the money -in fact, I don't want to know. Just drop by with that million, complete a little transaction I'll have arranged by then, and I'll get you what you want. Prestige. Respect. Fame. Infamy, whatever." A winning smile is flashed your way, and your hand is plucked up, shaken; a datachip is pressed into it. "Contact for an associate of mine, on the station I mentioned. Take the money there, bring the item back to me."`
	`	Finally, the Capo takes his turn. "Have you heard of the planet Darkstone, in the system Han? Pathetic bunch of dirt-farmers, only worthy of enslavement. Impose yourself as their master, take the meager tribute they offer, and return. Know that you'll make enemies this way, but really - if you want to be a pirate, I'm sure that's not something that concerns you overmuch."`
	`	The assembled outlaws have, by this point, exhausted what attention they'd budgeted on your behalf. The Mercenary dismisses you with a wave of the hand; the other two appear more concerned with an argument of their own until the Corsair finally pipes up with a final note for your departure. "Whichever path you take, we expect to be on Greenrock for the foreseeable future. Drop by once you've got something one of us will find impressive; or all, if that's your style."`

	`	As your nostrils fill with the scent of stale piss, cheap alcohol, and a modest breeze carrying the metallic tang of blood upon it, you come to your senses and realize that perhaps the pirate's life isn't as romantic as you'd made it out to be.`
	`	Leering eyes bore into your back as you beat a hasty retreat to your ship. Improbably, the alleys you dart through look even grungier on the route back than they did on the way here.`

conversation "I Want To Be A Pirate Conclusion"
	`Heads turn to regard you as you disembark into the Greenrock spaceport. Gangsters, pirates, slavers and smugglers regard you, size you up, and turn away with disinterest. That's far better than the ugly leers you used to get. Perhaps it's a swagger in your step, or simply a confident bearing that you now have - maybe you're just imagining things and reading what you want into the manifold expressions within the human morass that constitutes this busy spaceport.`
	`	You're paid no mind as you strut into the tavern and progress to another back room where, just as they said, the three pirates you'd met before are sharing drinks. Heads are lifted from tankards to regard you. The Corsair seems quite pleased to see you, assisted as he is by the reddened bonhomie of liquor. The fatigues-clad Mercenary remains impassive, her mien businesslike. And the Capo? He's just choked on his drink.`
	`	"Well slap a collar on me and sell me as a miner, you're still drawing breath. Didn't expect that. Here bearing profitable news, I trust." The Capo's speech is as metallic as ever, though his usual semi-musical tones sound somewhat... drowned. Seems he sucked some cider into his windpipe with that last sip.`

Accrue one million credits and hand them off to someone referred to you by a stranger you just happened to meet in a bar, for the promise of words whispered into the right ears. You'll need to head to Smuggler's Den, an orbital installation in the Men system.`
			`	Finally, you could murder a bunch of strangers and demand tribute from the survivors on pain of more ass-kicking. Specifically, strangers living on the planet of Darkstone. They probably deserve it anyways, or at least so says the cyborg who issued this task.`

			`Darkstone looks somewhat less depressing on your next landing. The village near the landing pad, rather than being blacked-out, is well-lit. The town center is piled high with scrap, apparently looted from the gang you ran off during your last visit. They've certainly made good on their promise, given the amount of labor it must have taken to haul this much in so little time. In fact, the village is far more lively than you'd have expected - the old folk and children must have come out of hiding, and even the adults are more numerous than last count. From what you can see during landing, everybody is assembled in the center of town - and your ship isn't the only one on the landing pad. Visitors?`
			choice
				`	(Disembark and head to the village center.)`
			`	The outskirts are abandoned. There's not a single hand tending the fields, or in the outlying buildings. They've all assembled at the town center.`
			`	As it turns out, they're not there to render tribute unto you as you might have thought. No, the villagers are all being held at gunpoint by a gang of toughs in the center of the village green while a nasty-looking piece of work examines them one at a time, then directs them into one queue or another. Colonists in one are shackled together. Those in the other are made to lie flat with their hands behind their heads. Not a single colonist dares to look up; the spirit of defeat hangs too heavily over these broken souls.`
			choice
				`	"What's going on here?"`
				`	(Stroll into the middle of town. Lock eyes with the leader of the slavers. Assume a gunfighter's stance.)`
					goto duel
				`	(Return to your ship. This is none of your business.)`
					goto retreat
				`	(Return to your ship... and start strafing the slavers.)`
					goto attack
			`	You're given an appraising look-over by the slaver chief. "... Yeah, you'd be too much trouble to sell. What'cha want, kid? We're busy here."`
			choice
				`	"These colonists are my property by right of conquest. If you're taking them, I expect to be fairly compensated."`
				`	"Actually, I was just leaving."`
					goto retreat
				`	"Whoah, whoah, whoah, I'm cool with forcing people to give me stuff because I'm holding them at gunpoint, but forcing them into slavery? That's sick."`
					goto challenge
			`	The chief works his jaw for a moment, deep in thought. "Alright. You soundly thrashed the last bunch of bastards who were here, so I'm inclined to think we're best off doing business. Wholesale rate on these skins is ten thousand a body. 'course, that's with no shipping and handling - factor that in and we can afford to give you ehhh... Quarter million for the lot of 'em. You'll still have some left once we're done, mind."`

			`	The slave boss counts out an appropriate stack of credits and presses them into your palm. The slaves regard you with a mixture of hatred and resignation. Now rather richer than you would have been just collecting their paltry tribute, you return to the skies.`
				flee
			label duel
			`	The leader of the slavers turns to face you, attention finally pulled from his task. "You've got some nerve picking a fight with us, kid. You really think these poor bastards are worth dying for?"`
			`	Noon's sun beats down on you. Even with the chill that usually haunts this region of the planet at this time of year, it's enough to bring sweat to your brow. Silence fills the town square, and slavers shy back to leave only four things that matter in the area: You, the slaver boss, and your respective pistols.`
			`	A bird cries in the distance.`
			choice
				`	(Draw!)`
			`	The slaver boss is fast, but you're faster. You're able to slip your sidearm out of its holster, level it, and cleanly blow him away before he can so much as draw a bead on you - and so it's with the thrill of victory that you die, as you're unceremoniously cut down by massed fire from the gang of slavers surrounding your little duel.`
			`	The few colonists that are left behind after the slavers have filled their holds honor your sacrifice by rolling your body into a ditch, spitting on it, and then promptly forgetting you ever lived.`
				die
			label retreat
			`	You retreat to your ship, unable or unwilling to defend your extortion-subjects against a slaver incursion.`

			`	"Yeah? And what do you think you can do about that?"`
			choice
				`	"You raise a compelling point, sir, and I wish you a good day while I leave to think further upon that."`
					goto retreat
				`	"I think I can kick your ass, that's what."`
					goto duel
				`	(Make your excuses and return to your ship. You'll be back - once your engines and weapons are warmed up.)`
			label attack
			`	You hustle back to your ship, slavers jeering at your back. They're not laughing long, however. They're caught unaware as you streak back toward the town, weapons hot and firing on clusters of slavers caught out in the open. Unarmored gangsters are no match for starship-grade weaponry, and your first volley reduces a good number of the guards to so much greasy mist. Your second pass initiates a full rout, as the slavers beat a hasty retreat from the village and back to the landing pad.`
			`	Survivors pour through the hatches and into their ships. Engines are warmed, weapons are brought online, and soon enough you're roaring out of atmosphere to finish this fight in the skies above.`
