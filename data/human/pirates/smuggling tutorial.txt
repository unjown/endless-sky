			`No spaceport is complete without somebody in dire straits asking passerby for help. This time the beggar is - from what you can observe that isn't concealed by bandages - a young man scarcely beyond his teens, what of his skin remains visible marked by a painful looking pattern of burns. Both hands and the entire right half of his head are wound in bandages, and his entire body carries a strong odor of disinfectants and salve; not strictly unpleasant, but still bordering on the overpowering.`

She walks in behind a pair of longshoremen piloting power loaders, each one bearing a pallet loaded with lashed crates upon their hydraulic claws. An eyepatch has replaced the bandages wrapping her head, which, combined with the swagger in her step, lends a distinctly roguish look to the young smuggler.`

			`	"Mixing up your cargo by transporting stuff like grain or metal or industrial equipment can sometimes throw off their scans and return false negatives. Any bulk commodity, really. Interference plating is great and makes that even more likely to happen, but it doesn't work on its own - it needs something to mix signals with."`
			`	"If you do get scanned and stopped, there's one of three ways it can go down. First, you simply accept the fine and surrender the cargo. Please don't do this? I'd rather not get whacked. If you're on your own job, though, sometimes it's better to just eat the fine once than pay a bunch of bribes because you're getting scanned over and over. Which brings us to the second option-"`
			`	"Good news is, most cops are just like you and me - out to make a buck and not too picky about how they do that. Paying them off is usually cheaper than whatever fine they decide to slap you with, and you'll get to keep your cargo. Just keep in mind that occasionally you'll run into an honest cop who won't take your bribe. And if you're not able or willing to bribe them, and you don't want to surrender your cargo, there's only one option left:"`
			`	"Run for it! This is going to seriously piss off the ISP and any Navy ships in the system, and might get interceptor fleets sent after anyone matching your description. But hey, at least you get to keep your payout at the end. Just lay low for a while and the ISP will usually cool down. Unless you're been shooting them down, that does tend to piss 'em off."`

It'll help stretch out the signal of any masking cargo we're carrying. Or, if you're feeling gutsy, just ask for 'tickets to the season playoffs', they'll set you up with some boxes of counterfeit credits. Ed always wants more of those, he'll pay a good sum.
